# Forecasting Models

Welcome to the **Forecasting Models** repository! This repository provides a collection of generic tools implemented in Python and R for various predictive modeling use cases. These tools are designed to help with:

1. Predicting the duration of the main case associated with a dataset.
2. Predicting the duration of a particular step/action/event within a case associated with a dataset.
3. Predicting the next step/action/event within an in-progress case associated with a dataset.

## Introduction

Predictive modeling is a powerful technique used in various fields to forecast future events based on historical data. This repository offers tools that leverage predictive analytics to solve specific problems related to case management. Whether you're working with legal cases, project management, or any other domain where understanding the flow and duration of events is crucial, these tools can provide valuable insights.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forecasting-models.git
```

### Python

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### R

Ensure you have R installed. Install the required R packages by running:

```R
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "caret", "randomForest"))
```

## Usage

Detailed instructions and examples for each tool can be found in their respective directories. Below are the general steps to use the tools provided in this repository.

### Predicting Case Duration

This tool helps in predicting the overall duration of a main case based on historical data.

#### Python

Navigate to the `python/predict_case_duration` directory and run:

```bash
python predict_case_duration.py --input data/case_data.csv
```

#### R

Navigate to the `R/predict_case_duration` directory and run the script:

```R
source("predict_case_duration.R")
```

### Predicting Step Duration

This tool focuses on predicting the duration of specific steps within a case.

#### Python

Navigate to the `python/predict_step_duration` directory and run:

```bash
python predict_step_duration.py --input data/step_data.csv
```

#### R

Navigate to the `R/predict_step_duration` directory and run the script:

```R
source("predict_step_duration.R")
```

### Predicting Next Step

This tool predicts the next step/action/event in an in-progress case.

#### Python

Navigate to the `python/predict_next_step` directory and run:

```bash
python predict_next_step.py --input data/sequence_data.csv
```

#### R

Navigate to the `R/predict_next_step` directory and run the script:

```R
source("predict_next_step.R")
```
